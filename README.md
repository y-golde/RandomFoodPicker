# Food Picker Carousel

## Why
Me and my significant other can't ever decide on a place to eat / order from because we can't pick one, so I've decided to randomise it by creating a <strong>REAL<strong> (_*ahem* , <strong>bootstrap</strong> *ahem*_) carousel 
that spins and lands on one of the options.

## Wait, but those locations are not next to me
Yea, the list of places is managed under `src/Resources/placesToEat` so you can clone/fork it and change it to whatever you like if you want
